# Single pulse test 

Single pulse test is a pipeline for testing the efficancy of single pulse detection algorithms. 
The pipeline injects synthetic guassian pulses and records the fraction of S/N recovered by a given single pulse algorithm for different dispersion measures (DM) and guassian widths (characterised by the sigma of the guassian). 





# Dependencies

The synthetic pulses are createsd useing [dynspec](https://github.com/hqiu-nju/simfred)
